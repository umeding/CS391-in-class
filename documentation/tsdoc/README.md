# Embedded Documentation for JavaScript

## Explanation:

- `@remarks`: Provides additional information about the class.
- `@param title`: Documents the title parameter, which is automatically inferred to be a string due to TypeScript's type system.
- `@returns`: Documents the return value of the getDescription method, which is also inferred to be a string.

`TSDoc` is very similar to `JSDoc`, but it is specifically designed for TypeScript
and leverages the type information available in your code. This means you often
don't need to explicitly specify types in your documentation comments, as they
can be inferred from the code.

To generate documentation from this code:

Install TypeDoc:

```bash
npm install -g typedoc
```

Run TypeDoc:

```bash
typedoc -name SparkBytes fooditem.ts
```

This will generate an HTML documentation website in a folder named docs. Open
the `docs/index.html` file in that folder to view your documentation.

Like `JSDoc`, `TSDoc` supports many more tags and features for documenting more
complex code. You can find more information and a complete list of tags in the
official `TSDoc` documentation: [https://tsdoc.org/](https://tsdoc.org/)
