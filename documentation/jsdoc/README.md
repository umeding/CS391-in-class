# Embedded Documentation for JavaScript

## Explanation:

- `@constructor`: Indicates that this function is a constructor.
- `@param {string} title`: Documents the title parameter, specifying its type as a string.
- `@member {string}`: Documents the title and author properties of the Food Item object.
- `@return {string}`: Documents the return value of the getDescription method.

To generate documentation from this code:

Install JSDoc:

```bash
npm install -g jsdoc
```

Run JSDoc:

```bash
jsdoc -d=docs fooditem.js
```

(Replace fooditem.js with the actual filename.)

This will generate an HTML documentation website in a folder named out. Open the `docs/index.html` file in that folder to view your documentation.

This is a very basic example. JSDoc supports many more tags and features for documenting complex code, including:

- `@class`: For documenting classes.
- `@namespace`: For documenting namespaces.
- `@typedef`: For defining custom types.
- `@example`: For providing code examples.

You can find more information and a complete list of tags in the official JSDoc documentation: [https://jsdoc.app/](https://jsdoc.app/)
